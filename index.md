## THE REFUGEE CRISIS IS SPIRALING OUT OF CONTROL
Every minute, 20 people are forced to abandon their homes because of violence or persecution. And if we put all 65.6 million of these people in one place, forming their own country, it would be larger than the United Kingdom. This is the refugee crisis—an immense and unimaginable suffering on a global scale.

### AND WE WANT TO FIX IT.
We are building a blockchain technology platform for refugee-led projects. This platform is accessed through ExsulCoin, a cryptocurrency which allows the holder to nominate, vote for, and fund these projects. Users of the platform can also earn ExsulCoin by completing needed tasks, such as delivering drinking water or supplying a medical clinic. In this way we are developing an ecosystem that empowers refugees through financial inclusion, and massively scaling the efficacy of current relief efforts.

### How it works 
1. Send a request to WeCoin team and include your full name and copy of your ID (picture is fine).
1. You will receive an agreement in response. Review it, sign it, and send it back.
1. Attached to the agreement will be banking information, as well as an wallet address. You can choose to send XLM to our wallet address, or fiat currency to our bank.
1. We will confirm your wallet details with you and send your WeCoin tokens directly to you.

# Why is it necessary?
Refugees live in a grey-area in society, where sex trafficking, extortion, and slavery are commonplace. Being able to track transactions within the community allows us to flag problems and alert relevant authorities, while keeping us accountable to the public.

Additionally, the immense public hatred for refugees means we needed a way for participants to have skin-in-the-game when interacting with refugees. (So if someone’s going to troll people on our platform, they’ll need to pay the victims for that.)

Lastly, refugees are generally don’t have credit cards and don’t trust financial institutions. Having a blockchain-based token from a community they’re a part of solves this issue
